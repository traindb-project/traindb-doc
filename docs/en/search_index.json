is TrainDB?\nTrainDB is an ML-model based approximate DBMS query engine that provides approximate but accurate enough query results based on machine learning models in order to support exploratory data analysis for timely business decision-making.\n\nTrainDB's key features are as follows:\n\nProviding approximate query results without access to base tables after ML model training\nRemote ML model training/serving with Kubeflow-based cloud ML model serving framework\nVarious DBMS data sources support \n\nTrainDB's Main R&D Topics\n\nTrainDB: an ML-model based approximate query processing engine\nSQL-like approximate query language\nApproximate query processing using synopsis data that are synthesized by ML models\nApproximate query processing using ML inference models\nVarious DBMS data sources support via extensible data source adapters\n\n\nML model library for approximate query processing\nSynopsis generative ML models + inferential ML models\nSynopsis generative ML models: GAN-based models(e.g., TableGAN, OCT-GAN), score-based generative models\nInferential ML models: mixture density networks(MDN), relational sum-product networks(RSPN)\n\n\nError estimation for approximate query evaluation\nContinual learning to update base table changes\n\n\nCloud ML model serving framework\nA framework for training/serving ML models in remote GPU servers\nKubeflow-based ML
